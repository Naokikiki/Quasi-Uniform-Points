# Quasi-Uniform Lattice Point Sets

This package provides implementations of quasi-uniform lattice point sets with bounded mesh ratios and its application to Gaussian process regression.


## Main Features

1. **Korobov Lattice Selection**: Selects the generator that maximizes the shortest vector in the dual lattice.

2. **Explicit Rank-1 Lattice**: Constructs lattices by approximating Kronecker sequences.

3. **Mesh Ratio Analysis**: Computes upper bounds on mesh ratios.

4. **Comparison Tools**: Compare with random, Halton, and Sobol sequences.
